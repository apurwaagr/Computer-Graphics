Cons:
- The Recursive Flood Fill Algorithm is absolutely inefficient. One also has to find a seed point. Techniques such as choosing a random seed point can lead to higher recursion trees.
- On top of that no shading is possible (just one color)

Pros:
- The algorithm is simple to understand and short
- The algorithm is correct
